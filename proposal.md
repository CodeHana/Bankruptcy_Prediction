## Bankruptcy Prediction


### Design:

A company faces bankruptcy when they are unable to pay off their debts. Before a company actually filing bankruptcy, many of the signs will reflect on the financial ratios. This projects aims to build a bankruptcy prediction model based on the data from Taiwan Economic Journal. It listed over 900 companies  including the details of company numerical attributes that may help understand the possibility of bankruptcy.
Also, I am interested in applying the model on the SP500 company data and analyzing the possibility of whether the company would face high probability of bankruptcy. 

### Summary:

Using any appropriate data source, build classification models that address a useful prediction and/or interpretation 
problem in any domain of interest. Communicate your process and findings in a 5 minute presentation at the end of week 
2 and a short written description.

Metis projects are broken down into 5 component parts -- **design, data, algorithms, tools, and communication** -- that 
are each scored individually. Below is a description of each component as it relates to this project. For more detail 
on how these components are graded and how extra points are rewarded, refer to the [project success guide](./project_success_guide.md).
